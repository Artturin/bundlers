# Nix Bundlers

Bundlers are a way to transform derivations. The most common and default
usage is based on the [original by
matthewbauer](https://github.com/matthewbauer/nix-bundle). Each bundler
is function over a value (usually a derivation) that produces another
derivation.

```console
$ nix bundle --bundler github:NixOS/bundlers nixpkgs#hello
```

# How to contribute

to provided an opinionated and curated list.

TODO: bundlers should be also discoverable on search.nixos.org

## What is required to submit a bundler?

Note: This section is a WIP

Each bundler needs:

- `name`

  Folder with the same name should be created and this is a location of the
  bundler. An entry with `name` is requred in `flake.nix`.

- `description`

  A description that explains the content of the bundler in one sentence. An
  entry with `description` is requred in `flake.nix`.

- `maintainers`

  Each bundler needs one of more maintainers with the knowledge of specific
  area. Each bundler has an entry in `.github/CODEOWNERS` with maintainers
  next to them.
